## JavaScript-Object

**In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.**

In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).


*ðŸ”° It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.*
